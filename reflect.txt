// I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

I have to design a set of workstations for this project containing a particular assortment of stock items. 
The line manager fills customer orders at each station as they are asked while moving them along the line. 
Each station processes a queue of orders by loading the following order in the queue 
if that order demands the station's item and that item is in stock. Each customer order consists of a list of items that need to be filled. 

I need a strong understanding of C++ object-oriented concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to finish this job. 
Managing supplies and orders between the locations are also crucial. 
By developing a solid data structure to store the orders, keep track of the products in stock at each station, 
deal with incomplete orders, and show a list of completed and incomplete orders once the line manager has processed all of the orders.


Finally, this project is broken down into three milestones to ensure that each one is completed before moving on to the next and 
that each milestone is thoroughly tested to find and fix any problems that may emerge.
