C++ School Project


I have to design a set of workstations for this project containing a particular assortment of stock items. 
The line manager fills customer orders at each station as they are asked while moving them along the line. 
Each station processes a queue of orders by loading the following order in the queue 
if that order demands the station's item and that item is in stock. Each customer order consists of a list of items that need to be filled.
